/**
 * This an example of test for {@link RESTSail} implement with
 * http://wiremock.org/docs/.
 * 
 * How this test was implemented:
 * 
 * 1) Start wiremock test recorder, execute the command in the root of the RS
 * code base - ./gradlew runWiremock
 * 
 * 2) Go to http://localhost:10220/__admin/recorder/ in the browser 3) Paste
 * https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org into Target URL input and click
 * "Recording" 4) Execute somehow the request as it should be send by the SAIL,
 * but instead of original URL use http://localhost:10220 as a base e.g for
 * nominatim search we need to execute something like:
 * 
 * curl
 * 'http://localhost:10220/search?q=British%20Museum&polygon_text=1&format=json&extraargs=1' -H 'Accept: application/json'
 * 
 * 3) Stop the recording, go to http://localhost:10220/__admin/mappings to see
 * the stub that we recorded, it contains Request + Response, the stubs are also
 * available in the ./mapping folder in the root of the RS code base
 * 
 * 4) Copy stub into some folder in the src/test/resources, e.g see
 * src/test/resources/org/researchspace/sail/rest/mappings/osm-nominatim-search-bm-request-mock.json
 * 
 * 5) Initialize wireMock pointing to the folder one level up from mappings, e.g
 * in this case it is org/researchspace/sail/rest
 * 
 * 6) Now you can issue your test queries to SAIL repo
